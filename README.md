## 🚨 Project Deprecated – Use Lara Dashboard Instead

> **Note:** This repository (LaraCMS) is no longer actively maintained.
>
> We’ve built a far more powerful and modular solution called **[Lara Dashboard](https://github.com/laradashboard/laradashboard)** — a complete CMS and admin panel built on Laravel (7.x - 12.x), Tailwind CSS, and fully modular architecture.

### ✅ Why Switch to Lara Dashboard?

* Modern UI with **Tailwind CSS** & **Dark/Light Mode**
* Fully **modular system** – plug & play modules
* Built-in management for **Users, Roles, Permissions**
* **Settings, Translations, Logs, Monitoring**
* **Charts, Tables, Forms**, and many more components
* Actively maintained and continuously improved
